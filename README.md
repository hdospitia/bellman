# Bellman.sh

This script aims to install basic DevOps tools, to automate this time-consuming task.
Most of the tools are installed using Homebrew as the default package manager.

# Usage
Once this repo is cloned, just hit (make sure that the file has execution permissions):
```
./bellman.sh
```

This script has been tested in modern Ubuntu systems.

Any suggestion is welcome.

Thanks for supporting.
